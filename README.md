# Consumer Rights Wiki Chrome Extension

A simple chrome extension which checks if the current website / company has 
entries in [Consumer Rights Wiki](https://consumerrights.wiki).

## Examples

If you visit a Website (e.g. [volkswagen.com](https://volkswagen.com), the 
extension checks if the company name (volkswagen) is contained in a article's title.

The extension, when pinned, shows directly a red mark, with a number indicating the number of articles.

![Consumer Rights Wiki shows a number of found articles for Volkswagen.de](Documentation/Images/crw-Example-VW.png)

## Setup Chrome Extension from this Repo

The extension is not yet published to Chrome Webstore, but you can locally install it.

Download the repo in a folder. 
Then follow this guide on how to enable local [chrome extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started)

## Idea

The idea was given by Louis Rossmann in [InfiniteQuant revokes lifetime access after buying VPNSecure: don't trust VPNSecure, 15:55](https://youtu.be/VWSq9i8D2hE?si=0cnhJm6nAV8_m3y1)
