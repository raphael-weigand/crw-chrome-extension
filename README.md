# Consumer Rights Wiki Chrome Extension

A simple chrome extension which checks if the current website / company has 
entries in [Consumer Rights Wiki](https://consumerrights.wiki).

## Examples
If you visit a Website (e.g. [volkswagen.com](https://volkswagen.com), the 
extension checks if the company name (volkswagen) is contained in a article's title.

The extension, when pinned, shows directly a red mark, with a number indicating the number of articles.

![Consumer Rights Wiki shows a number of found articles for Volkswagen.de](Documentation/Images/crw-Example-VW.png)
